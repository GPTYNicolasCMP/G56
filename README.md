## Introduction

This model was inspired by the NASCAR stock car known as "Garage 56," which was built for the 24 Hours of Le Mans. To make it, we used the remains of an outdated remote-controlled car that is identical in model to the Garage 56 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 1LE. This was created using a timelapse of a month during which we built the model to be as close to the Garage 56's performance as possible while staying inside the constraints of the Lego Mindstorms set. Additionally, testing this model took a long time, during which we encountered many failures that we have now resolved.
